# MCIDE
MCIDE is an open source IDE for Minecraft development, based on the IntelliJ Platform.

## Where Are The Sources?
MCIDE is still in development. The sources will be made public as soon as the product releases.

### Supported Platforms

- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Sponge
- Forge
- LiteLoader
- MCP
- Mixins
- BungeeCord
- Waterfall
- Fabric (new!)
- Canary
- Neptune

Each platform has its own plugin, so you can customize MCIDE according to your needs as a Minecraft developer. MCIDE doubles as a Java IDE, with amazingly intelligent code completion and refactoring capabilities. On top of this, custom Minecraft file types such as .lang files have intelligent code completion based on your project.

### IntelliJ Platform

If you're familiar with IntelliJ IDEA, you already know how to use MCIDE. MCIDE is based on the tried and true IntelliJ Platform, the same framework used to create well known JetBrains products, such as CLion and DataGrip.

Using the automatic project import tool, eclipse projects can be switched to MCIDE without problems.

### Special Features

There's more to MCIDE than advanced code completion and refactoring. MCIDE is planned to have many extra features, such as a built in JSON model editor, automatic project creation and more. More details will be revealed on release.
