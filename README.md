# MCIDE
MCIDE is an open source IDE for Minecraft development, based on the IntelliJ Platform.

## Where Are The Sources?
MCIDE is still in development. The sources will be made public as soon as the product releases. :D

### Advert! :D
For the first time ever, Minecraft developers have a single, intelligent IDE for all their Minecraft Development needs.

Being that MCIDE is built in part by Init Studios, a Minecraft modding studio, we know what you guys want.

### Supported Platforms

- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Sponge
- Forge
- LiteLoader
- MCP
- Mixins
- BungeeCord
- Waterfall
- Fabric (new!)

Each platform has it's own plugin, so you can customize MCIDE according to your needs as a Minecraft developer. MCIDE doubles as a Java IDE, with amazingly intelligent code completion and refactoring capabilities. On top of this, custom Minecraft file types such as .lang files have intelligent code completion based on your project.

### IntelliJ Platform

If you're familiar with IntelliJ IDEA, you already know how to use MCIDE. MCIDE is based on the tried and true IntelliJ Platform, the same framework used to create well known JetBrains products, such as CLion and DataGrip.

Migrating from eclipse? No worries! Using the automatic project import tool, your eclipse projects can switch to MCIDE with no issues!

### Special Features

There's more to MCIDE than advanced code completion and refactoring. MCIDE is planned to have many extra features, such as a built in JSON model editor, automatic project creation and more. More details will be revealed on release.

## Thanks For Having A Look!

When it's released, I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it.
